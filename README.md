# MLDailyDev

This repository is one I have created for personal reasons. This is a public tracker of my efforts of getting better at development in ML, a skill that i've learnt
is indispensible. Here I will gradually detail my journey through learning to code through simple problems, and eventually graduate to more complex ones. It's a try to do everything from scratch , and I'm hoping it will be something that benefits me in the long term. 

All the code written here is written by only looking at docs or searching for specific doubts on Google and Stackoverflow. The idea behind this is to learn the working behind every function and resist the want to copy code. Although inefficient, this is what I see as my initial plan to get better at coding. 

All coding will be using PyTorch, as that is the framework I want to learn.

The structure of what I've learnt will be detailed under each experiment.

## First Experiment
Training a Convolutional Network on CIFAR10.
